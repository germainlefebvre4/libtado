**libtado** is a simple Python library that provides methods to control the smart heating devices from the German company [tado GmbH](https://www.tado.com)[^1]. It uses the undocumented REST API of their website.

The library is in NO way connected to tado GmbH and is not officially supported by them!

The source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/germainlefebvre4/libtado)[^2]. Feel free to report issues or open pull requests.
